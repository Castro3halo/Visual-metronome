# Visual Metronome
A simple overlay that displays a box that changes color every game tick. Used for the same purposes as the regular metronome, timing based activities such as PvM or 3-tick fishing. Helpful for if you don't have sound, are listening to music, or just prefer a visual cue instead of auditory.

# Usage
Turn on plugin and alt+click to drag overlay to desired location on your screen.

Configure the width and colour of the overlay in the settings.
