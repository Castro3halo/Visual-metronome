# Visual Metronome
A simple overlay that displays a box that changes color every game tick. Used for the same purposes as the regular metronome, timing based activities such as PvM or 3-tick fishing. Helpful for if you don't have sound, are listening to music, or just prefer a visual cue.

# Usage
Turn on plugin, alt+click to change width and drag overlay to desired location on your screen. 

- If you need the size to be smaller, use the fixed size option.

# Settings

Alt+click and drag on border of overlay to change width (unfortunately cannot change height)

If you want the overlay to be smaller or fixed in size, use the last two settings.

# Changelog
- **V1.1**
    - Add ability to change width by alt+dragging the border. (Thanks to m0bilebtw for the suggestion)
    - Default settings change
- **V1.1.1**
    - Add back option to use fixed size since the overlay minimum size might be too high.
