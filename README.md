# Visual Metronome ![Total installs](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://i.pluginhub.info/shields/installs/plugin/visual-metronome)
A simple overlay that displays a box that changes color every game tick. Used for the same purposes as the regular metronome, timing based activities such as PvM or 3-tick fishing. Helpful for if you don't have sound, are listening to music, or just prefer a visual cue.

# Usage
Alt+click on the border of the overlay to change the size

Alt+right click on the overlay to reset to default size
